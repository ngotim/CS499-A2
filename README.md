The entities I have created are Vehicle Make, Model, Details, Fuel Type.

Make has a one-to-many relationship to Model since one maker can have multiple different models of a car.
Model has a one-to-many relationship to Details because a car model can have different details depending on the specific car.
Details has a many-to-one relationship to Fuel Type because there are different type of fuels but only so many to choose from so different cars have varying fuel types.
